# Magic Lambda HTTP

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.http.svg?master)](https://travis-ci.org/polterguy/magic.lambda.http)

Provides HTTP REST capabilities for [Magic](https://github.com/polterguy/magic). More specifically it provdes 4 slots.

* __[http.get]__ - Returns some resource using the HTTP GET verb towards the specified URL.
* __[http.delete]__ - Deletes some resource using the HTTP DELETE verb.
* __[http.post]__ - Posts some resources to some URL using the HTTP POST verb.
* __[http.put]__ - Puts some resources to some URL using the HTTP PUT verb.

The __[http.put]__ and the __[http.post]__ slots requires you to provide a __[payload]__, which will be pass to the
endpoint as s string. All 4 endpoints can (optionally) take a __[token]__ arguments, which will be transferred as a `Bearer Authorization`
token to the endpoint, in the HTTP Authorization header of your request.

## License

Although most of Magic's source code is publicly available, Magic is _not_ Open Source or Free Software.
You have to obtain a valid license key to install it in production, and I normally charge a fee for such a
key. You can [obtain a license key here](https://servergardens.com/buy/).
Notice, 5 hours after you put Magic into production, it will stop functioning, unless you have a valid
license for it.
